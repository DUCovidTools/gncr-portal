                            <li>The main theme this week is that, despite two weeks of a slow departure from
                                lockdown
                                almost all of the authority districts in the North East regions have flattened
                                their
                                curves.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>This is true for all trends, from the slowest to the worst!</li>
                                    <li>New cases have also slowed down (see Figure 2 below).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Leeds, County Durham and Sheffield – the three starkest trends – continue to
                                flatten
                                This is particularly true for Sheffield.</li>
                            <li>Overall, the majority of authority districts (n=16) in the North East regions
                                remain
                                part of the slowest trends in England and Italy.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li> Over the past week, the total number of authority districts in the North East
                                regions
                                in the slowest curves in England and Italy stayed roughly the same at n=16
                                (roughly
                                59%). Following last week, most of the trends continue to remain relatively
                                flat;
                                however, a few, such as Kingston upon Hull, have had a slight uptick.
                            </li>


                            <li> The daily number of new cases (over the last two weeks) across all n=27
                                authority
                                districts support this general insight, with many slowing down and levelling. As
                                further
                                demonstration, a trend line was plotted for Gateshead and County Durham, which
                                show the
                                number of new cases does seem to be slowing down and have passed the peak.
                            </li>




                            <li> Bradford continue to also be part of the slow to moderate growing trends. But,
                                while
                                higher than the slowest trends, Bradford was going up as of last week. This week
                                it
                                appears to be levelling off slightly.
                            </li>

                            <li>Moderate trends for Sunderland, Newcastle, North Yorkshire, Rotherham and
                                Northumberland, North Yorkshire, Gateshead and Barnsley all appear to have
                                flattened.
                            </li>


                            <li> Leeds and County Durham continue to level off. While two of the curves with the
                                highest numbers in the North East, North Yorkshire and Humber regions, relative
                                to the
                                entire England and Italy dataset they are not part of the worst curves.
                            </li>




                            <li> Even Sheffield has levelled off and continues to be relatively flat, despite
                                being
                                the most severe trend in the North East and North Yorkshire.
                            </li>

            <p>The COVID-19 Community Health and Social Care Modelling Team is under the guidance of our respective
                Executive Deans, Jacqui Ramagge (Science) and Charlotte Clarke (Social Sciences and Health) as part of
                the
                contribution of the Wolfson Research Institute for Health and Wellbeing and the Institute of Data
                Sciences
                to the University’s Health@Durham strategy, as well as supported by the Durham Advanced Research
                Computing
                team, Research and Innovation Services,
                Marketing and Communications and CECAN (Centre for the study of Complexity Across the Nexus).</p>

            <p>The team is
                led by Dr Camila Caiado and Professor Brian Castellani, with the purpose of creating a series of tools
                and
                dashboards that Trusts and Councils can use to help support decision and planning accordingly. Some of
                these
                tools are hosted by Durham University through IBM’s cloud, which they have provided presently for free
                as
                part of our Academic Partnership. We would also like to acknowledge the outstanding contribution of Dr
                Jennifer Badham, Dr Peter Barbrook-Johnson, Professor Amanda Ellison, Dr Andrew Iskauskas, Dr Bernard
                Piette, Dr Rachel Oughton, and Dr Corey Schimpf.</p>
